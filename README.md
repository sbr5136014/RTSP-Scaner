# Windows RTSP Scanner

A Windows-compatible utility for scanning networks to discover RTSP camera streams.

## Overview

This tool helps you find RTSP cameras on your network by:
1. Scanning IP ranges for open RTSP ports
2. Testing discovered endpoints with common RTSP paths
3. Verifying working streams by capturing a frame

Unlike other RTSP scanners, this tool was designed specifically to work on Windows without requiring any Unix-specific modules.

## Features

- üîç Network scanning with CIDR notation support
- üîë Multiple credential testing
- üõ£Ô∏è Common RTSP path discovery
- üßµ Multi-threaded for faster scanning
- üìä Progress reporting
- üíæ Optional JSON output

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- FFmpeg installed and available in your PATH

## Installation

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed)
   - Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   - During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

2. **Install FFmpeg**
   - Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
   - Extract the files to a folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg`)
   - Add the `bin` folder to your PATH:
     - Open Control Panel ‚Üí System ‚Üí Advanced System Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
     - Edit the PATH variable and add the path to FFmpeg's bin folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`)
     - Verify the installation by opening a new Command Prompt and typing:
       ```
       ffmpeg -version
       ```

3. **Download the scanner script**
   - Save the `windows_rtsp_scanner.py` file to your computer

## Usage

### Basic Command

```
python windows_rtsp_scanner.py -a 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-a`, `--address` | IP address or network in CIDR notation | `192.168.1.0/24` |
| `-p`, `--ports` | Comma-separated list of ports to scan | `554,8554` |
| `-c`, `--credentials` | Comma-separated list of credentials in format username:password | None |
| `-P`, `--paths` | Comma-separated list of RTSP paths to try | Various common paths |
| `-t`, `--timeout` | Timeout in seconds for each RTSP test | `10` |
| `-r`, `--retries` | Number of retries for each RTSP test | `2` |
| `-o`, `--output` | Output file for discovered cameras (JSON format) | None |
| `-w`, `--workers` | Maximum number of concurrent workers | `50` |

### Examples

#### Scan your local network with default settings
```
python windows_rtsp_scanner.py -a 192.168.1.0/24
```

#### Scan with specific credentials
```
python windows_rtsp_scanner.py -a 192.168.1.0/24 -c admin:admin
```

#### Try multiple credential sets
```
python windows_rtsp_scanner.py -a 192.168.1.0/24 -c admin:admin,admin:password,root:root
```

#### Scan specific ports
```
python windows_rtsp_scanner.py -a 192.168.1.0/24 -p 554,8554,10554
```

#### Custom RTSP paths
```
python windows_rtsp_scanner.py -a 192.168.1.0/24 -P /live,/h264Preview_01_main,/Streaming/Channels/101
```

#### Save results to a file
```
python windows_rtsp_scanner.py -a 192.168.1.0/24 -o results.json
```

#### Scan a specific IP address
```
python windows_rtsp_scanner.py -a 192.168.1.100/32
```

#### Reduce timeout for faster scanning (but potentially missing slow streams)
```
python windows_rtsp_scanner.py -a 192.168.1.0/24 -t 5
```

## Understanding the Output

The scanner outputs information in several stages:

1. **Port Scanning Phase**:
   - Shows progress as it scans your network
   - Reports open ports as they're found

2. **RTSP Testing Phase**:
   - Tests each open port with various RTSP paths
   - Reports successful connections

3. **Results Summary**:
   - Lists all discovered potential RTSP sources (open ports)
   - Lists all working RTSP streams with their URLs

## Common RTSP Paths

The scanner tests the following common RTSP paths by default:
- `/Streaming/Channels/101` (Hikvision)
- `/live` (Generic)
- `/live2` (Generic alternative)
- `/h264Preview_01_main` (Some IP cameras)
- `/h264Preview_01_sub` (Sub-stream for some IP cameras)
- `/cam/realmonitor` (Dahua)
- `/live/ch00_0` (Various IP cameras)
- `/live/ch00_1` (Various IP cameras)

You can specify custom paths using the `-P` option.

## Common Credentials

Most IP cameras use one of these default credentials:
- admin:admin
- admin:password
- admin:12345
- admin:[blank]
- root:root
- root:admin
- root:password

**Important**: Always change default passwords on your cameras after installation!

## Troubleshooting

### FFmpeg Not Found
If you see "Error: ffmpeg is required but not found in PATH":
1. Make sure FFmpeg is installed
2. Verify FFmpeg is in your PATH by typing `ffmpeg -version` in a command prompt
3. If the command doesn't work, revisit the FFmpeg installation steps

### No Open Ports Found
1. Verify your network address is correct
2. Try scanning different ports (`-p` option)
3. Check your firewall settings

### No Working Streams Found
1. Try different credentials (`-c` option)
2. Try different RTSP paths (`-P` option)
3. Increase timeout (`-t` option) and retries (`-r` option)
